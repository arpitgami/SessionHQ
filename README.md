# SessionHQ

**High-signal 1:1 sessions for early-stage founders.**  
SessionHQ is a curated platform that connects startup founders with seasoned operators for meaningful, 1:1 sessions. Our goal is to make expert advice accessible through frictionless scheduling, real-time communication, and seamless infrastructure.


## Why Use SessionHQ

Let us give you two solid reasons to consider our platform:

1. Our onboarding process ensures that experts don’t get spammed with irrelevant requests. Only serious founders reach out, which keeps interactions focused and meaningful.

2. Because our experts are protected from spam and appreciate the quality of engagement, we’re able to attract the very best in the industry. As a user, this means you can connect with top-tier operators and get real help with your startup challenges.
